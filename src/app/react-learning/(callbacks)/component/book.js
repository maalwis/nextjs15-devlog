/*
  Book Component

  This component receives multiple props:
  - name: The title of the book
  - author: The author of the book (optional)
  - year: The publication year (optional)
  - onBookClick: A callback function to be called when the book is clicked

  The goal is to demonstrate how a child component can invoke a function
  passed down from its parent using props. This approach allows the parent
  to handle child-level events such as clicks, selections, form submissions, etc.

  This pattern follows React's unidirectional data flow principle - data flows down
  as props, and events flow back up through callbacks.

function Book ( { name , author , year , onBookClick } ) {
    /*
      Event Handler: handleClick

      - This function is defined inside the child component.
      - It calls the `onBookClick` function received via props
        and passes the book name as an argument.
      - This creates a layer of abstraction that allows the component
        to perform additional logic before calling the parent's callback.
