/*
  Movie Component

  This component receives movie data and a callback function as props:
  - title: The title of the movie
  - director: The director's name
  - year: The release year
  - rating: The movie's rating (out of 10)
  - genres: An array of genre categories
  - onMovieSelect: A callback function triggered when the movie is selected

  The component demonstrates how to receive and handle props that were passed
  using the spread operator syntax. This approach simplifies the parent component's
  code but requires careful documentation in the child component about expected props.

  Best Practice: Even though props are spread from the parent, we still destructure
  them explicitly here for clarity and to document the component's API.

    /*
      Event Handler: handleSelect

      - Local event handler that wraps the received callback.
      - Provides an abstraction layer that could include additional logic.
      - Calls the parent-provided callback with the movie title.
      - This pattern allows the component to be self-contained while still
        communicating with its parent.
