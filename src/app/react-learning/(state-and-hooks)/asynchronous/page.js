/**
 * Understanding the Asynchronous Nature of React State Updates
 *
 * This component demonstrates how React state updates are asynchronous
 * and why it is important to use updater functions when your new state depends
 * on the previous state. In React, when you call a state setter function like
 * setCount, the state change does not occur immediately. Instead, React schedules
 * the update, and may batch multiple updates for performance optimizations.
 *
 * This means that if you perform several state updates in a row, they might all
 * refer to the same initial state value if you don't use an updater function.
 * Updater functions ensure that each update works with the most recent state.

     * the component with the new count value when ready.

     * Explanation of the problem:
     * When calling setCount(count + 1) twice in a row, both calls capture the same value of 'count'
     * at the time the function is executed. For example, if count is 5:
     *   - The first call computes 5 + 1, so it sets the count to 6.
     *   - The second call also computes 5 + 1 (because count is still 5 in this execution context),
     *     so it also sets the count to 6.
     *
     * Even though two updates are scheduled, React batches them together, and the net effect
     * is that the count only increases by 1 instead of 2.

     *
     * By using an updater function (i.e., a function that receives the previous state as an argument),
     * we guarantee that each update is based on the most current state value.
     *
     * For example, if count is 5:
     *   - The first updater call receives 5 and returns 6.
     *   - The second updater call then receives the updated value (6) and returns 7.

                    <p>
                        In React, state updates are <strong>asynchronous</strong> by design. When you invoke a state setter function such as <code>setCount</code>,
                        the update is scheduled rather than happening instantly. This allows React to optimize performance by batching
                        multiple state updates into a single re-render.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This asynchronous behavior means that reading the state immediately after calling its setter might not reflect the new value.
                        Instead, the update is queued, and the component is re-rendered later with the latest state.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you perform multiple state updates that depend on the current state value (e.g., <code>setCount(count + 1)</code>),
                        each update may refer to the same outdated value of <code>count</code>. This can lead to unexpected results.

                        To ensure that each state update works with the most current value, pass an updater function to <code>setCount</code>.
                        This function takes the previous state as its argument, ensuring that consecutive updates are applied correctly.
