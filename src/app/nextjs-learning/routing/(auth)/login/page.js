// This file defines the login route for our authentication flow.
// Similar to the register route, this page is organized within a route group folder named "(auth)".
// The use of parentheses here informs Next.js that this folder is used only for grouping purposes,
// ensuring that the folder name is not included in the URL structure.
// Hence, the login page will be available at '/login'.
//
// The route group approach is especially beneficial for sharing a common layout or
// context among related routes without forcing the layout's path into the URL.
// This organization becomes invaluable in team environments where clear separation of concerns,
// modularity, and maintainability are priorities.
